Android Reading List App

A friend of mine wanted a simple android app that was basically a reading list in which they could check books they already read, add and manage books, and it should include the BBC 100 "need to read" books from the start.

This is my first ever app I developed so I learned a bit about SQLite and Kotlin, since i chose to use this language for implementing the activities. The IDE i used is Android Studio.

I implemented a Java helper class for handling the Database Connections.
There are 3 activites: MainActivity, edit_book_activity and add_book_activity which should be self-exlanatory.
Corresponding XML layouts exist for these actions as well as one for the listview I used to display the list of books.

Feel free to review this project and use it. If you have any comments feel free to contact me.
